Gaussian HJM model for term-structure modeling.

Inherits From: [`QuasiGaussianHJM`](../../../tf_quant_finance/models/hjm/QuasiGaussianHJM.md)

```python
tf_quant_finance.models.hjm.GaussianHJM(
    dim, mean_reversion, volatility, initial_discount_rate_fn, corr_matrix=None,
    dtype=None, name=None
)
```

Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) model for the interest rate term-structre
modelling specifies the dynamics of the instantaneus forward rate `f(t,T)`
with maturity `T` at time `t` as follows:

```None
  df(t,T) = mu(t,T) dt + sum_i sigma_i(t,  T) * dW_i(t),
  1 <= i <= n,
```
where `mu(t,T)` and `sigma_i(t,T)` denote the drift and volatility
for the forward rate and `W_i` are Brownian motions with instantaneous
correlation `Rho`. The model above represents an `n-factor` HJM model.
The Gaussian HJM model assumes that the volatility `sigma_i(t,T)` is a
deterministic function of time (t). Under the risk-neutral measure, the
drift `mu(t,T)` is computed as

```
  mu(t,T) = sum_i sigma_i(t,T)  int_t^T sigma_(t,u) du
```
Using the separability condition, the HJM model above can be formulated as
the following Markovian model:

```None
  sigma(t,T) = sigma(t) * h(T)    (Separability condition)
```
A common choice for the function h(t) is `h(t) = exp(-kt)`. Using the above
parameterization of sigma(t,T), we obtain the following Markovian
formulation of the HJM model [1]:

```None
  HJM Model
  dx_i(t) = (sum_j [y_ij(t)] - k_i * x_i(t)) dt + sigma_i(t) dW_i
  dy_ij(t) = (rho_ij * sigma_i(t)*sigma_j(t) - (k_i + k_j) * y_ij(t)) dt
  r(t) = sum_i x_i(t) + f(0, t)
```
where `x` is an `n`-dimensional vector and `y` is an `nxn` dimensional
matrix. For Gaussian HJM model, the quantity `y_ij(t)` can be computed
analytically as follows:

```None
  y_ij(t) = rho_ij * exp(-k_i * t) * exp(-k_j * t) *
            int_0^t exp((k_i+k_j) * s) * sigma_i(s) * sigma_j(s) ds
```

The Gaussian HJM class implements the model outlined above by simulating the
state `x(t)` while analytically computing `y(t)`.

The price at time `t` of a zero-coupon bond maturing at `T` is given by
(Ref. [1]):

```None
P(t,T) = P(0,T) / P(0,t) *
         exp(-x(t) * G(t,T) - 0.5 * y(t) * G(t,T)^2)
```

The HJM model implementation supports constant mean-reversion rate `k` and
`sigma(t)` can be an arbitrary function of `t`. We use Euler discretization
to simulate the HJM model.

#### Example. Simulate a 4-factor HJM process.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf
import tf_quant_finance as tff

dtype = tf.float64
def discount_fn(x):
  return 0.01 * tf.ones_like(x, dtype=dtype)

process = tff.models.hjm.GaussianHJM(
    dim=4,
    mean_reversion=[0.03, 0.01, 0.02, 0.005],  # constant mean-reversion
    volatility=[0.01, 0.011, 0.015, 0.008],  # constant volatility
    initial_discount_rate_fn=discount_fn,
    dtype=dtype)
times = np.array([0.1, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
short_rate_paths, discount_paths, _, _ = process.sample_paths(
    times,
    num_samples=100000,
    time_step=0.1,
    random_type=tff.math.random.RandomType.STATELESS_ANTITHETIC,
    seed=[1, 2],
    skip=1000000)
```

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google/tf-quant-finance/blob/master/tf_quant_finance/models/generic_ito_process.py">View source</a>

```python
fd_solver_backward(
    start_time, end_time, coord_grid, values_grid, discounting=None,
    one_step_fn=None, boundary_conditions=None, start_step_count=0, num_steps=None,
    time_step=None, values_transform_fn=None, dtype=None, name=None, **kwargs
)
```

Returns a solver for Feynman-Kac PDE associated to the process.

This method applies a finite difference method to solve the final value
problem as it appears in the Feynman-Kac formula associated to this Ito
process. The Feynman-Kac PDE is closely related to the backward Kolomogorov
equation associated to the stochastic process and allows for the inclusion
of a discounting function.

For more details of the Feynman-Kac theorem see [1]. The PDE solved by this
method is:

```None
  V_t + Sum[mu_i(t, x) V_i, 1<=i<=n] +
    (1/2) Sum[ D_{ij} V_{ij}, 1 <= i,j <= n] - r(t, x) V = 0
```

In the above, `V_t` is the derivative of `V` with respect to `t`,
`V_i` is the partial derivative with respect to `x_i` and `V_{ij}` the
(mixed) partial derivative with respect to `x_i` and `x_j`. `mu_i` is the
drift of this process and `D_{ij}` are the components of the diffusion
tensor:

```None
  D_{ij}(t,x) = (Sigma(t,x) . Transpose[Sigma(t,x)])_{ij}
```

This method evolves a spatially discretized solution of the above PDE from
time `t0` to time `t1 < t0` (i.e. backwards in time).
The solution `V(t,x)` is assumed to be discretized on an `n`-dimensional
rectangular grid. A rectangular grid, G, in n-dimensions may be described
by specifying the coordinates of the points along each axis. For example,
a 2 x 4 grid in two dimensions can be specified by taking the cartesian
product of [1, 3] and [5, 6, 7, 8] to yield the grid points with
coordinates: `[(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (3, 5) ... (3, 8)]`.

This method allows batching of solutions. In this context, batching means
the ability to represent and evolve multiple independent functions `V`
(e.g. V1, V2 ...) simultaneously. A single discretized solution is specified
by stating its values at each grid point. This can be represented as a
`Tensor` of shape [d1, d2, ... dn] where di is the grid size along the `i`th
axis. A batch of such solutions is represented by a `Tensor` of shape:
[K, d1, d2, ... dn] where `K` is the batch size. This method only requires
that the input parameter `values_grid` be broadcastable with shape
[K, d1, ... dn].

The evolution of the solution from `t0` to `t1` is often done by
discretizing the differential equation to a difference equation along
the spatial and temporal axes. The temporal discretization is given by a
(sequence of) time steps [dt_1, dt_2, ... dt_k] such that the sum of the
time steps is equal to the total time step `t0 - t1`. If a uniform time
step is used, it may equivalently be specified by stating the number of
steps (n_steps) to take. This method provides both options via the
`time_step` and `num_steps` parameters. However, not all methods need
discretization along time direction (e.g. method of lines) so this argument
may not be applicable to some implementations.

The workhorse of this method is the `one_step_fn`. For the commonly used
methods, see functions in <a href="../../../tf_quant_finance/math/pde/steppers.md"><code>math.pde.steppers</code></a> module.

The mapping between the arguments of this method and the above
equation are described in the Args section below.

For a simple instructive example of implementation of this method, see
<a href="../../../tf_quant_finance/models/GenericItoProcess.md#fd_solver_backward"><code>models.GenericItoProcess.fd_solver_backward</code></a>.

  to the spatial grid `G` above.
* <b>`values_grid`</b>: Real `Tensor` containing the function values at time
  `start_time` which have to be stepped back to time `end_time`. The shape
  of the `Tensor` must broadcast with `[K, d_1, d_2, ..., d_n]`. The first
  axis of size `K` is the values batch dimension and allows multiple
  functions (with potentially different boundary/final conditions) to be
  stepped back simultaneously.
* <b>`discounting`</b>: Callable corresponding to `r(t,x)` above. If not supplied,
  zero discounting is assumed.
* <b>`one_step_fn`</b>: The transition kernel. A callable that consumes the following
  arguments by keyword:

    2. 'next_time': The next time to step to. For the backwards in time
      evolution, this time will be smaller than the current time.
    3. 'coord_grid': The coordinate grid.

  The i'th element of the list is a 2-tuple containing the lower and upper
  boundary condition for the boundary along the i`th axis.

  Default value: 0 (i.e. no previous steps performed).
* <b>`num_steps`</b>: Positive int scalar `Tensor`. The number of time steps to take
  when moving from `start_time` to `end_time`. Either this argument or the

  solution from `t0` to `t1`. Corresponds to the `n_steps` parameter
  above.

  be one of the following (in order of generality): (a) None in which case
    `num_steps` must be supplied. (b) A positive real scalar `Tensor`. The
    maximum time step to take. If the value of this argument is `dt`, then
    the total number of steps taken is N = (t0 - t1) / dt rounded up to
    the nearest integer. The first N-1 steps are of size dt and the last
    step is of size `t0 - t1 - (N-1) * dt`. (c) A callable accepting the
    current time and returning the size of the step to take. The input and
    the output are real scalar `Tensor`s.
* <b>`values_transform_fn`</b>: An optional callable applied to transform the

  values grid. All input arguments to be passed by keyword.
* <b>`dtype`</b>: The dtype to use.
* <b>`name`</b>: The name to give to the ops.

Returns a solver for the Fokker Plank equation of this process.

The Fokker Plank equation (also known as the Kolmogorov Forward equation)
associated to this Ito process is given by:

```None

    - (1/2) Sum[ (D_{ij} V)_{ij}, 1 <= i,j <= n] = 0
```

with the initial value condition $$V(0, x) = u(x)$$.

This method evolves a spatially discretized solution of the above PDE from
time `t0` to time `t1 > t0` (i.e. forwards in time).
The solution `V(t,x)` is assumed to be discretized on an `n`-dimensional
rectangular grid. A rectangular grid, G, in n-dimensions may be described
by specifying the coordinates of the points along each axis. For example,
a 2 x 4 grid in two dimensions can be specified by taking the cartesian

    random_type=None, seed=None, skip=0, name=None
)
```

Returns a sample of simulated discount curves for the Hull-white model.


#### Args:


* <b>`times`</b>: A real positive `Tensor` of shape `[num_times,]`. The times `t` at
  which the discount curves are to be evaluated.
* <b>`curve_times`</b>: A real positive `Tensor` of shape `[num_curve_times]`. The
  maturities at which discount curve is computed at each simulation time.
* <b>`num_samples`</b>: Positive scalar `int`. The number of paths to draw.
* <b>`time_step`</b>: Scalar real `Tensor`. Maximal distance between time grid points
  in Euler scheme. Used only when Euler scheme is applied.
  Default value: `None`.
* <b>`num_time_steps`</b>: An optional Scalar integer `Tensor` - a total number of
  time steps performed by the algorithm. The maximal distance betwen
  points in grid is bounded by
  `times[-1] / (num_time_steps - times.shape[0])`.
  Either this or `time_step` should be supplied.
  Default value: `None`.
* <b>`random_type`</b>: Enum value of `RandomType`. The type of (quasi)-random
  number generator to use to generate the paths.
  Default value: None which maps to the standard pseudo-random numbers.

  `HALTON_RANDOMIZED` the seed should be an Python integer. For
  `STATELESS` and  `STATELESS_ANTITHETIC` must be supplied as an integer
  `Tensor` of shape `[2]`.
  Default value: `None` which means no seed is set.
* <b>`skip`</b>: `int32` 0-d `Tensor`. The number of initial points of the Sobol or
  Halton sequence to skip. Used only when `random_type` is 'SOBOL',
  'HALTON', or 'HALTON_RANDOMIZED', otherwise ignored.
  Default value: `0`.

  Default value: `sample_discount_curve_paths`.


#### Returns:

A tuple containing three `Tensor`s.

* The first element is a `Tensor` of shape
`[num_samples, num_curve_times, num_times]` containing the simulated
zero coupon bond curves `P(t, T)`.
* The second element is a `Tensor` of
shape `[num_samples, num_times]` containing the simulated short rate
paths.

Computes the state variable `y(t)` for tha Gaussian HJM Model.

For Gaussian HJM model, the state parameter y(t), can be analytically
computed as follows:

y_ij(t) = exp(-k_i * t) * exp(-k_j * t) * (
          int_0^t rho_ij * sigma_i(u) * sigma_j(u) * du)

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google/tf-quant-finance/blob/master/tf_quant_finance/models/generic_ito_process.py">View source</a>

```python
volatility_fn()
```

Python callable calculating the instantaneous volatility.

The callable should accept two real `Tensor` arguments of the same dtype and
shape `times_shape`. The first argument is the scalar time t, the second
argument is the value of Ito process X - `Tensor` of shape `batch_shape +
[dim]`. The result is value of volatility `S_ij`(t, X). The return value of
the callable is a real `Tensor` of the same dtype as the input arguments and
of shape `batch_shape + [dim, dim]`.

#### Returns:

The instantaneous volatility callable.
